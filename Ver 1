[	2	,	2	, "	 Amulet of Hope -  Shines as bright as a candle, but only when there are no other light sources. Light points back towards dungeon entrance, vaguely. Hums reassuringly when clutched, and warms your hand..	" , "		"],

[	4	,	4	, "	 Ring of the Adventurous Limb -  If worn on a hand, the entire arm will vanish. It will return after 24 hours have elapsed. Roll a d10: 1 - tattoo on arm, 2 - arm injured, 3 - gained a ring, probably a wedding ring, 4 - ring missing, 5-10 - nothing special. It will have a similar effect on legs..	" , "	T2	"],
[	5	,	5	, "	 Dust of De-Appearance -  Can make things invisible, but wears off if the object moves, is moved, or even wiggles a bit. Best used on inanimate objects or people who can hold really, really, still..	" , "		"],
[	6	,	6	, "	 Paired Scrolls -  Whatever is written on one appears on the other. Give players a 3x5 card to write on, to limit how much they can write..	" , "		"],
[	7	,	7	, "	 Statuette of Baal -  Can be fed gold to grow larger, adding to its. Starts out the size of a gold coin. Becomes more complex as it grows larger, adds features and companions. If grown to the size of 100,000 gp, golden tablet reveals great secret. (Does not create or destroy gold, just absorbs it.) If grown to 1,000,000 gp, it will come alive and try to take over the world..	" , "		"],

[	9	,	9	, "	 Black Cigarette -  When smoked, it creates a huge cloud of smoke and allows the smoker to see through smoke and fog. Can be smoked for 5 minutes (or 5 one-minute segments)..	" , "		"],
[	10	,	10	, "	 Colorthief's Brush -  This paintbrush has a needle on the back. If you prick something, you steal all the color from it, but can later paint with those same brilliant colors (stored in the brush, controlled by imagination). If a book is pricked, it will steal the words. The book can then be reconstructed, but it takes a few days of writing for it to be recovered..	" , "		"],
[	11	,	11	, "	 Sleeping Draught -  Sleep TWICE AS HARD for four hours. You get a full night's rest, but cannot be woken up. Unwilling targets get a save..	" , "		"],

[	20	,	20	, "	 Bottle of Light -  When swung overhead (a small chain is attached for this purpose) the bottle absorbs ambient light. Later, the bottle can be unstoppered to allow the light back out again. Can hold up to 5 rounds of light. Special properties of light are preserved: moonlight can induce lycanthropy, for example..

[	23	,	23	, "	 Goggles of the Clown -  When worn, everything looks like a clown, and speaks in a mocking, clowning voice. It is very difficult to tell people apart. You can barely tell a knight apart from his horse (which appears as a four-legged clown). In combat, you must make a Wisdom check every round or lose track of which clown is which. On the upside, you are immune to the beauty of nymphs and the ugliness of catoblepas..	" , "		"],
[	24	,	24	, "	 Vial of Nightshade -  When drunk, it puts the body into a deep coma and ejects the spirit. You can now roam around, incorporeal, until you return to your body. There is a 1-in-6 chance each hour that some mishap befalls you (body possessed by outsider, soul lost forever, etc). Coma lasts for 1d3 days..	" , "		"],
[	25	,	25	, "	 Grinning Amulet -  Anyone who laughs--even a snicker--near this amulet must make a save or laugh uncontrollably for the next minute. Careful, it's contagious--if a player laughs during this, so does their character..	" , "		"],

[	28	,	28	, "	 Boots of Independence -  When you remove these boots and fail to restrain them (put them in a pack, etc) they will walk back the way they came, all the way back to where you first put them on, with more-or-less the same cadence and sounds. If you walked in a loop somewhere along the line, the boots will get stuck in the loop and repeat..	" , "		"],
[	29	,	29	, "	 Tiny tree -  Produces three fat apples every day (enough to feed 1 person). Must be watered with 1 cup of blood each day, or it will die. If dead, can be revived with water. Probably found dead/in a chest..	" , "		"],
[	30	,	30	, "	 Skeleton gourd -  This gourd has a peephole. Anyone holding the gourd up to their face and looking into the peephole will be paralyzed while their brain is filled with visions of dancing skeletons..	" , "		"],
[	31	,	31	, "	 Ring of Petrification -  Putting this ring on will turn a person to stone, except for the ring. Someone else can remove the ring, and thereby return them to flesh..	" , "		"],
[	32	,	32	, "	 Party Book -  This book creates audible illusions imitating a party. The state of the party depends on the page the book is opened to. If the book is turned to page 1, you'll hear a couple people setting up silverware. Middle of the book, raucous carousing. Near the end, mostly snores and a few people taking shots..	" , "		"],

Can paint up to a 3' diameter spot, or 10 3 peepholes. Penetrates no more than 6. Getting it on someone's face blinds them..	" , "		"],

[	38	,	38	, "	 Ring of Swimming -  Wearer treats air as if it had the consistency of water. You can fly by swimming through the air, but the air is too thick to breath. Other water penalties also apply..	" , "		"],
[	39	,	39	, "	 Belt of Cat Imprisonment -  When laid on the ground, felines are compelled to sit in the center of it. As charm..	" , "		"],
[	40	,	40	, "	 Endless Boots -  Cannot stop walking. Will never tire from walking. Cannot run. Walk walk walk..	" , "		"],
[	41	,	41	, "	 Spike of Woodland Suicides -  Sort of like a hunter's trap. When left in the woods, wild animals will come and impale themselves on it. A verdant forest yield 1d10 rations worth per day, but must be moved daily. Fey will fucking hate you, though..	" , "		"],

[	47	,	47	, "	 Boots of Devouring -  Cursed. As soon as you put one on your foot it starts fucking eating you like a garbage disposal. Feeding it lots of booze causes it to vomit out everything in its stomache (which may include some treasure)..	" , "		"],
[	48	,	48	, "	 Fox-in-a-Bag -  Sleeps all the time. As soon as it touches the ground, it will run around like crazy. Dex 18, AC as plate because of high Dexterity + foxy nature. If you pick it up (good luck) it will fall back asleep..	" , "		"],

Drawing on these spirits, the Ark consumes any and all crop or plant matter in a maddened hunt for nourishment.

The heart can be used as a spellcasting focus, and when used as such, all spells made with the heart count as two levels above the level of the spellslot used. Flaw- the heart is still unstable, and all physical damage done directly to the heart causes the heart to violently react. When this happens, the heart gives off a violent blast of magical energy, dealing radiant damage equivalent to the original attack in a 20ft radius sphere. If attacked by necrotic damage this ability does not trigger, and the heart takes double damage. Destroyed by: The heart has 100 HP total. If the heart reaches 0 due to physical damage, it violently collapses, dealing 10d10 radiant damage in a 300ft sphere.

Even traveling between universes and realities is possible. The magical power can also be used to cast spells. Destroyed by: Since once you’ve unlocked a normal door, it stays unlocked, the doors that the Key opens stay open until you have left back through the door you have created. Thus, the only way to destroy the Key would be to open the room where you are unable to interact with anything, and then leave the key in that room, and then close the door.

In order to attune to this artifact you must hold it pressed to your heart during a short rest. The artifact slowly enters your chest and fuses with your heart. Unattuning kills the person because the artifact can’t be unfused from their heart. While attuned to this artifact you have advantage on death saving throws. Also you can open up a portal that leads to the plane of Mechanus or back to the material plane from Mechanus once per day. Modrons recognize Primus’ creation and will avoid fights with the person attuned the clockwork heart unless they are attacked. Once a creature has attuned to the Clockwork Heart, they begin to gradually lose the ability to feel emotion and instead become more logical. The process is slow, but speeds up significantly whenever an aspect of the heart is used (such as opening a portal to Mechanus or making a death saving throw only because of the advantage provided by the artifact).

The mirror itself can also cast various mind control spells on targets visible in the mirror at the user’s behest (DM’s discretion on which and the number of uses per day). The insidiousness is multiplied because the mirror’s control is such that targets may not realize that they were influenced by a spell, especially if they were only instructed to do reasonable things. The mirror can even be used to disadvantage the charisma and wisdom saving throws of targets visible in it if needed. Other Suggestions: The Machiavellian Mirror’s owner should be intelligent and paranoid, someone who takes all sorts of mundane and magical precautions to prevent the mirror from being visible and even having a reflection, especially when not in use. The owner should also take precautions to make sure they are knowledgeable of even potential threats, and that they are visible and findable at all times (e.g. command a ring of spies). Destroyed by: If the Machiavellian Mirror can “see” its own reflection clearly, (e.g. another mirror or smooth surface polished finely is brought into close range in appropriate lighting conditions), the mirror spontaneously smashes itself into smithereens and becomes useless.
